Creating a Bounty microservice along with an Authentication microservice in a system that uses PostgreSQL for data storage, pgx for database actions, and JWT for authentication involves several detailed steps. Here’s how we will proceed:

### Step 1: Define System Requirements and Architecture
1. **Identify Functional Requirements**: Define what functionalities your Bounty and Authentication services need to support. This includes user authentication, JWT creation with custom claims, bounty creation, viewing, updating, and claiming bounties.
2. **Choose Technology Stack**: Confirm the use of Go, PostgreSQL, pgx/migrate, and JWT for handling security.
3. **Define Microservice Architecture**: Plan how these microservices will interact with each other and other parts of your system.

### Step 2: Setup Development Environment
1. **Install Go and Setup Go Environment**: Make sure Go is installed and set up correctly on your development machine.
2. **Set Up PostgreSQL**: Install PostgreSQL and create the necessary databases and roles.
3. **Install pgx**: Add pgx to your project to handle interactions with your PostgreSQL database.

### Step 3: Implement Authentication Service
1. **User Model and Database Setup**: Define a user model and use migrate to create corresponding tables in PostgreSQL.
2. **Password Hashing**: Implement password hashing using Argon2id to store user passwords securely.
3. **JWT Handling**: Develop functionality to create JWTs with custom claims based on user data (like user role, location, etc.).
4. **Login and Registration Endpoints**: Create API endpoints for user registration and login, returning JWT upon successful authentication.

### Step 4: Implement Bounty Microservice
1. **Bounty Model and Database Setup**: Define a bounty model and use pgx for managing database operations.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Implement endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting bounties. Make sure these endpoints handle data according to business logic.
3. **Authorization Middleware**: Develop middleware to verify JWT and check custom claims to restrict or allow access to different bounties based on the user’s role or other claims.

### Step 5: Security and Authorization
1. **Secure Communication**: Ensure all communications between services and with clients are secured using TLS.
2. **Service-to-Service Authentication**: Implement secure methods (like internal API keys or service accounts with JWT) for services to communicate with each other securely.
3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC in both services to handle permissions based on user roles contained in JWT claims.

### Step 6: Testing
1. **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for individual functions and methods, especially focusing on business logic, data handling, and edge cases.
2. **Integration Testing**: Test the integration between the microservices, particularly focusing on data flow and API interactions.
3. **Load Testing**: Perform load testing to ensure that the system can handle the expected number of requests and concurrent users.

### Step 7: Deployment
1. **Containerization**: Containerize the services using Docker to simplify deployment and scaling.
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.

### Step 8: Monitoring and Maintenance
1. **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging for both microservices to capture errors and unusual behaviors.
2. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up monitoring tools to track the performance of the microservices and database, and configure alerts for any critical issues that might arise.

### Step 9: Documentation
1. **API Documentation**: Document the API endpoints using tools like Swagger or Postman.
2. **Developer Documentation**: Create detailed developer documentation covering the system architecture, setup guide, and contribution guidelines.
