For a user model that can interact with bounties in a system where authentication via JWT (JSON Web Token) is required, you'll want to define attributes that enable identity verification and user capabilities within the context of bounties. Hereâ€™s a suggested structure for such a user model, along with the relevant behaviors and methods related to bounty interaction:

### User Model Definition

**1. Attributes:**

- **ID (Primary Key)**: A unique identifier for each user, typically an integer or UUID.
- **Username**: A unique name used for user identification.
- **Email**: The user's email address, often used for communication and account verification.
- **Password Hash**: Encrypted password for secure authentication.
- **Role**: Defines the user's role within the system (e.g., Admin, Regular User, Viewer), which dictates permissions.
- **JWT**: The JSON Web Token that is generated upon login and used for validating subsequent requests.
- **Created At**: Timestamp when the user account was created.
- **Updated At**: Timestamp when the user account was last updated.

**2. Relationships:**

- **Created Bounties**: Bounties that the user has created, linking back to the Bounty model.
- **Claimed Bounties**: Bounties that the user has claimed or is assigned to, also linked to the Bounty model.

**3. Methods and Behaviors:**

- **Login**: Authenticates the user and generates a JWT.
- **Logout**: Invalidates the user's JWT to log out the user.
- **ClaimBounty(bountyId)**: Method to claim a bounty. Validates if the bounty is available and if the user has the required permission.
- **SubmitWork(bountyId, submission)**: Submits work for a claimed bounty. This includes handling submission details and updating the bounty status.
- **ViewBounties()**: Method to retrieve available bounties based on user permissions and roles.
- **UpdateProfile(details)**: Allows the user to update their own profile information.

### Database Schema

When designing the database schema for this User model using an ORM such as Gorm, ensure that fields align with the attributes above, considering secure storage of sensitive information like password hashes. Relationships to the Bounty model should be clearly defined through foreign keys.

### Security Considerations

- **JWT Handling**: Ensure that JWTs are securely generated and stored, and include essential information for user authentication and role verification.
- **Password Security**: Implement strong encryption for storing passwords, and ensure secure authentication mechanisms are in place.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Properly implement and test RBAC to ensure users can only perform actions appropriate to their role.

This User model is designed to facilitate secure and effective interactions within a bounty system, ensuring users can perform their roles efficiently while maintaining system security and integrity.
